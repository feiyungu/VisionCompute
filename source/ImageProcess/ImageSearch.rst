Introduction

`Content-based image retrieval <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_CBIR_engines>`_  list most of the CBIR engine. after screening, I decided to use `fire <http://thomas.deselaers.de/fire/>`_  due to it use the C++ and Python. but I should study each one's feature, 

for example `akiwi <http://www.akiwi.eu/>`_  is a semi-automatic image keywording tool using CBIR techniques.
`Tinyeye <http://www.tineye.com/>`_  support search the background. 

`gift <http://www.gnu.org/software/gift/>`_  GNU  tools image finding tools.
`imgseek <http://www.imgseek.net/desktop-version/user-s-guide>`_  seems good also.
